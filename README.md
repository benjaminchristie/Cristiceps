Goal is to make a working uci chess engine in python that can interface with both Arena3 and Lichess.

As of 1/31/21, capable of making random legal moves without crashing on Arena3. Not on lichess (yet).
2/1/21, plays at about a 200 elo level, still need to fix eval glitches. Can play on cmd line.
